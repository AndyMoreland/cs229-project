The Perfect IHUM Essay: Grading Essays with Machine Learning
==================================================================

By Andy Moreland and Charlie Guo

This repository contains the code and written work that went into our Fall 2012 CS 229 project at Stanford University. We collected roughly 125 essays from Stanford students and were able to predict whether they would receive an A or a B with roughly 74% accuracy. This beats a max likelihood predictor by approximately 16%. 

Please note that the ruby code in this repository is atrocious -- it was thrown together very rapidly in order to do what we needed. There are many hacks and the code relies upon external file structure very heavily. It's probably not worth attempting to run this code.

We heavily leveraged the [Rainbow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mccallum/bow/) text classifier by Andrew McCallum.
