The Perfect IHUM Essay: Grading Essays with Machine Learning
==================================================================

By Andy Moreland and Charlie Guo

This repository contains the code and written work that went into our Fall 2012 CS 229 project at Stanford University. We collected roughly 125 essays from Stanford students and were able to predict whether they would receive an A or a B with roughly 74% accuracy. This beats a max likelihood predictor by approximately 16%. 

We heavily leveraged the [Rainbow]:http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mccallum/bow/ text classifier by Andrew McCallum.
